This database of breast cancer patients was acquired from the SEER Program of the NCI's November 2017 update, which offers details on population-based cancer statistics. The dataset included female patients who had been diagnosed between 2006 and 2010 with infiltrating ductal and lobular carcinoma breast cancer (SEER primary cites recode NOS histology codes 8522/3). In the end, 4024 patients were included after the exclusion of patients with uncertain tumor sizes, studied regional LNs, positive regional LNs, and patients whose survival months were less than one month.
